Within the Fluid Dynamics class taken in my Junior year, we had a final group assignment where we were tasked with taking apart and disecting a chainsaw. This was taken over a week to study, and ended with a video presentation about the chainsaw. Within the disection we were able to take measurements of certain engine dimensions as well as calculating parameters such as Reynold's number and efficiencies. This helped to understand the purpose of certain components, and taught us how to make the design better.
