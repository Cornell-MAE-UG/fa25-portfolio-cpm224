Within my System Dynamics class taken the fall of my junior year, I was apart of a group project that took apart and analyzed a milk frother. Within this project, we analysized the DC motor, and collected high speed videos in order to analyze the frother in steady state and coast down. Specifically, I worked on post processing the high speed videos and developing the transfer functions to descibe the system.
