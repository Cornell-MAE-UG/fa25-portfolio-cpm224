For my Material's class in the Fall of my Junior year, we analyzed a torque wrench in a FEM and compared those results with hand calcs done. Within the first part of the assignment, we were given a baseline of the torque wrench and the given stress, strain, and deflection. This was in order to find the corresponding values through an FEA. Then within the second part, we were given a set of parameters and use hand calcs and an FEA to support the design.
